<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Daniya Roghay! I'm a student currently pursuing my BSc in IT. While I’m still at the beginning of my journey, I’m deeply passionate about logic, art, and mathematics. These three elements inspire and drive my curiosity in the world of technology.</p>
   
<p>Though I’m just starting out, I’m eager to learn, grow, and connect with like-minded women, especially fellow Muslimaat who share similar interests and experiences. I’m excited about the future and the opportunities to create meaningful work in the tech space.</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to reach out—I’d love to connect!</p>
